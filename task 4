Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one might be wrong.)

apple APPLE Apple2 1Apple account number account_number account.number accountNumber fred Fred return return_value 
5Return GreatBigVariable greatBigVariable great_big_variable great.big.variable 2x

account number –> because because it has space between words
return –> because it’s keyword
